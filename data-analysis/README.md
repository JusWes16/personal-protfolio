# Overview

For this little project I wanted to take a look at the IMDb movies database found on kaggle.com https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset. 
This data set holds a lot of information about movies from Miss Jerry made in 1894 to modern films made in 2020. This information includes everything from gross income
to cast. I love movies and so I wanted to take a look at this dataset to see what the trends are and whether or not I could find the answers to the questions I had.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

* Instead of turning all non-US currency values to 0, convert them to USD
* Includes graphs to display more data related to these questions
* Maybe break the code up a little more so not so much of it is in the print statements.
