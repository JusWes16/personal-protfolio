# Overview

This is a secure password generator created in Python. The purpose of this program is to give the user a way to easily create secure passwords for use in their lives. This program is like others that you see on the internet but 
here to have the comfort o knowing that all of the generation is done locally on your computer, nothing behind the scenes. In this program I use a variety of different methods to accomplish my goal. This could have been done 
more simply but I also wanted to exhibit my understanding of the different ways to solve a problem in Python. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
