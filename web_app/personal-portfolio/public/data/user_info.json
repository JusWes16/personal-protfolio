I started my time in college as an accounting major for about two years in I realized that this wasnt the path for me. I had taken some programming classes for a certificate and after leaving accounting I decided that I wanted to pursue programming as a career.  Since then I have been studying as a Software Engineering major at BYU-Idaho for the past two years set to graduate April of 2021. ",
